    "text": "Assignments and Grading\nGrading for the class is S/NC. Your grade will be based on the following:\n\n\n\nComponent\nWeight\n\n\n\n\nParticipation\n20%\n\n\nWeekly assignments\n20%\n\n\nWorkflow critique\n20%\n\n\nFinal project\n40%\n\n\n\n\nParticipation\nYou are expected to attend each class and participate in class discussions. Readings should be completed prior to class so that you can contribute to discussions.\n\n\nWeekly Assignments\nI will assign short practical assignments after most weeks of class. These exercises will develop your skills in R programming and other concepts that we discuss. You are allowed to work in groups of 2-3 students to complete these exercises if you would like, but each student should turn in their own assignment. Please indicate in the top of your assignment the names of the students you worked with. Some class time will be given so that you can start work on the assignment with the help of the instructor/TA. Office hours are also available for help on assignments.\n\n\nWorkflow Self-Critique\nYou should choose a current or past data analysis project that you have worked with (or one from your lab if you are a newer student). In a short paper (3-4 pages), you will first describe the end-to-end workflow of your data. What are sources of raw data? How are those sources combined and/or processed? What research personnel, computing resources, software, and hardware devices are involved? What is the end product needed for statistical analysis? Next, you will take a critical eye to your workflow and identify 1) Where are errors most likely to occur, 2) What time-consuming steps could be automated, and 3) how your workflow could be made more transparent and reproducible. You will briefly present your workflow critique in class. Each student will work individually on this assignment.\n\n\nFinal Project\nIn your final project, you will improve the data workflow that you chose using skills learned in this class. Your final project should be shared with the instructor and TA through an online repository (such as Github, OSF, or Code Ocean) and allow your end-to-end data workflow to be reproduced (e.g., include raw data files, functions that implement processing steps, etc.). You can use whatever programming languages are necessary (it doesn’t need to just be in R), but you should consult with the instructor if R will not be used to ensure that the instructor can run your code (or alternatively, that you demonstrate your workflow to the instructor). Your project should be a report, either to demonstrate exploratory analyses or to communicate the results, that is written in R Markdown and contains visualizations written in R."
