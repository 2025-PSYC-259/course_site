The [80/20 rule](https://www.pragmaticinstitute.com/resources/articles/data/overcoming-the-80-20-rule-in-data-science/) is the idea that data scientists spend 80% of the time cleaning/preparing the data but only 20% of the time actually running analyses. It makes sense. Most interesting data sets are complicated, messy, unwieldy, and full of mistakes. A model is only as good as the data that go into it, so a careful data scientist aims to simplify, clean, and correct a dataset into something more manageable. Since Psychology PhD students take a lot of classes about modeling---the 20%---so this one class attempts to help you get better at the remaining 80%.

In a nutshell, this means becoming better at programming. As data cleaning and visualization become easier through automation and more efficient coding, you gain insights about your data, catch mistakes more easily, and avoid tedious tasks (<kbd>CTRL</kbd><kbd>C</kbd> and <kbd>CTRL</kbd><kbd>V</kbd>). No one can learn every bit of a programming language (especially not in a quarter). But if you learn enough about what a language *can do*, you'll know what to learn in the future when you need it.

This course follows along with [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) and makes use of tons of free materials out there in the data science community to help people learn how to wrangle data. Even this website (adapted from Andrew Heiss's [Data Visualization course website](https://github.com/andrewheiss/datavizs24.classes.andrewheiss.com)) is an example of the kinds of things you can build with the tools we cover in this class (click on "edit this page" below to see how this site was built). Aside from the [syllabus](syllabus.qmd), [lectures](lectures/lectures.qmd), and [assignments](assignments/assignments.qmd), this site also contains [resources](resources.qmd) that might help you as you search for the tools you need for your own applications.
