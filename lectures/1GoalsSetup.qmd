## GitHub Practice

If you have git, a GitHub account, and the GitHub Desktop Client, let's try to fork a repository to your own account.

- Navigate to [https://github.com/2025-PSYC-259/package_install](https://github.com/2025-PSYC-259/package_install).
- Click "fork". This will make a fork of the repository under your own account.
- In your repository, click "Code" and then "Open with GitHub Desktop"
- This should open up the GitHub Desktop Client. From that application, choose a  non-cloud location on your local machine to store the cloned repository. A good place would be User/Documents/Github.
- Use GitHub to jump to the directory (or navigate through Finder/Explore) and then open the project.
- Try changing the package_install.R file and saving the change. You should now see that change registered in GitHub Desktop.
- If you want, you can commit the change with a message and push it back to the origin. Now it will be saved in your GitHub repository in the cloud.
